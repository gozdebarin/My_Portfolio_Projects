## Eniac Data Exploration | SQL

### Project Objectives & Overview
#### 1. Overview
The company: Eniac is an online marketplace specializing in Apple-compatible accessories. It was founded 10 years ago in Spain and it has since grown and expanded to other neighboring countries.

Here are some numbers that will help you understand Eniacâ€™s scope (data from April 2017 â€“ March 2018):

Revenue: 40,044,542 â‚¬
Avg monthly revenue: 1,011,256 â‚¬
Avg order price: 710 â‚¬
Avg item price: 540 â‚¬

#### 2. Purpose of the Project

The main objective of this project is whether to advise Eniac to expand into the Brazilian market and to sign a contract with Magist, a Brazilian Software as a Service company that offers a centralized order management system.

In this project, I analyzed the dataset gaining the following skills:

- **SQL syntax and how to use SQL:** This part includes SELECT, SELECT DISTINCT, WHERE, AND, OR, IN, NOT IN, LIKE, wildcards, NULL, NOT NULL, ORDER BY.

- **SQL Aggregation:**  This part includes COUNT, COUNT DISTINCT, SUM, AVG, MAX, MIN, GROUP BY, and HAVING.

- **SQL Analysis:** This is where I thought analytically and answer many analytical questions using advanced SQL techniques. This part includes JOINS, CASE statements.

#### 3. Main Concerns

Eniacâ€™s catalog is 100% tech products, and heavily based on Apple-compatible accessories. It is not clear that the marketplaces Magist works with are a good place for these high-end tech products.

Among Eniacâ€™s efforts to have happy customers, fast deliveries are key. The delivery fees resulting from Magistâ€™s deal with the public Post Office might be cheap, but at what cost? Are deliveries fast enough?

Thankfully, Magist has allowed Eniac to access a snapshot of their database. The data might have the answer to these concerns.

I answer these concerns by exploring the data using SQL

#### 4. Conclusions

- Eniac's avg price 540 > Magist's avg price of tech products 132.
- The avg monthly revenue of Eniac is 1,011,256 > 131,118 the avg monthly revenue of all Magist tech sellers.
- The average delivery time is 12 days in Magist market, while Apple standard delivery time is 1-3 days.

**Final Recommendation:** 
There is a lack of data to make a better educated decision. However, according to the available data Magist is not a good fit for high-end tech products. Therefore, I recommend that Eniac should not sign the deal with Magist.
