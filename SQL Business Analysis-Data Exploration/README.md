## Eniac Business Analysis  & Data Exploration | SQL

### Project Objectives & Overview
#### 1. Overview
The company: Eniac is an online-shop. Eniacâ€™s catalog is 100% tech products, and heavily based on Apple-compatible (high-end) accessories.

#### 2. Purpose of the Project

The main objective of this project is whether to recommend Eniac to sign a contract with Magist, a Brazilian Software company that offers a centralized order management system.

It is not clear that the marketplaces Magist works with are a good place for these high-end tech products.

Among Eniacâ€™s efforts to have happy customers, fast deliveries are key. Are deliveries fast enough on Magist?

Thankfully, Magist has allowed Eniac to access a snapshot of their database. The data might have the answer to these concerns.

I answer these concerns by exploring the data using SQL and visualize it using Tableau.

In this project, I analyzed Magist's dataset gaining the following skills:

- **SQL syntax and how to use SQL:** This part includes SELECT, SELECT DISTINCT, WHERE, AND, OR, IN, NOT IN, LIKE, wildcards, NULL, NOT NULL, ORDER BY.

- **SQL Aggregation:**  This part includes COUNT, COUNT DISTINCT, SUM, AVG, MAX, MIN, GROUP BY, and HAVING.

- **SQL Analysis:** This is where I thought analytically and answer many analytical questions using advanced SQL techniques. This part includes JOINS, CASE statements, Subqueries.

#### 3. Conclusions

- Eniac's avg price 540 > Magist's avg price of tech products 132.
- The avg monthly revenue of Eniac is 1,011,256 > 131,118 the avg monthly revenue of all Magist tech sellers.
- The average delivery time is 12 days in Magist market, while Apple standard delivery time is 1-3 days.

**Final Recommendation:** 
There is a lack of data to make a better decision. However, according to the available data, Magist is not a good fit for high-end tech products. Therefore, I recommend that Eniac should not sign the contract with Magist.
