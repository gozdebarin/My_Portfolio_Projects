Data had to be requested, structured, and visualized. First a database is built in mySQL Workbench based on the data. Then the scripts are transferred to the cloud (Amazon Web Services) and scheduled to be executed every 24 hours. Iteratively, an SQL database of weather and flight-information is built in the cloud.\n","\n","ðŸ“¢ðŸ“¢ðŸ“¢ There is a Medium article about this project at: \n","\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"jPSMB7yItr0H"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["### 1.2.
