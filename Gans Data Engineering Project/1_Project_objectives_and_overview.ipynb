Business Problem\n","Gans is a startup developing an e-scooter-sharing system.\n","\n","It aims to operate in the most populated cities all around the world. In each city, it will have hundreds of e-scooters parked on the streets and allow users to rent them by the minute.\n","\n","#### 2. Purpose of the Project\n","\n","The aim of this project is to collect data from external sources that can potentially help Gans to predict e-scooter movement.\n","\n","#### 3. Steps of the Project\n","\n","- Data Collection: collect data via web scraping or API (Application Programming Interfaces)\n","- Data Storage: create a Database on a local MySQL instance and store the collected data there\n","- Pipeline to the Cloud: use Amazon Web Services (AWS) to move the pipeline to the cloud\n","- Pipeline Automation: automate the whole data collection and storage process\n","\n","\n","#### 4. Data Collection\n","\n","The data is collected from:\n","\n","- Cities Data -> Wikipedia\n","- Weather Data -> OpenWeatherMap\n","- Airports Data -> Rapid API (AeroBox)\n","- Flights Data -> Rapid API (AeroBox)\n","\n","#### 5. Technical Skills\n","\n","- Python (BeautifulSoup, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib)\n","- Requests (API) & Web Scraping\n","- Amazon Web Services (AWS)\n","- SQL, SQLAlchemy (Connect Python with MySQL)\n","\n","#### 6. Project Summary\n","\n","The automated data pipeline in the cloud was implemented in the following steps:\n","\n","- Web scraping on a website (Wikipedia) to collect demographic data\n","- Using APIs to collect weather, airport, and flight data (OpenWeatherMap & AeroDataBox APIs)\n","- Creating a database on a local MySQL instance to store data from various data sources\n","- Moving the script and data to the cloud using Amazon Web Services (AWS) and automating the data development pipeline\n","\n"]}],"metadata":{"colab":{"authorship_tag":"ABX9TyMAp4ahiYFGR312qcadZ4cf","provenance":[]},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"name":"python"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":0}
